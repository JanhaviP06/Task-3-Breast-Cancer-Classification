# Task-3-Breast-Cancer-Classification

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide after lung cancer and hence, it becomes extremely crucial to identify it at an early stage, which can considerably increase the chances of survival.

The most important part in cancer detection is to be able to **differentiate between benign and malignant tumors** and this is where the work of Machine Learning comes in. Taking all the dependent features upon consideration, Supervised Machine Learning methods allow for classification with higher degree of accuracy using **Random Forest with 97% accuracy**. The result is dependent on the most correlated factors with the target variable. The main aim is to provide a comprehensive view on prediction of breast cancer through Machine Learning through data analyses, which can play a pivotal role in prevention of misdiagnosis in future.

The dataset used for this project is **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.**

**Dataset Link :** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

**Attribute Information:**

ID number
Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c) perimeter

d) area

e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

i) symmetry

j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features.

**The analysis includes the following sections :**

* Understanding the problem and dataset
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Pre-Processing the Data
* Train the data using ML models
* Compare the accuracy values for models and select best model
* Predict whether breast cell tissue is Malignant or Benign
* Build Webapp using Streamlit
  
The Streamlit app contains a user-friendly UI where the user can enter the analysis values and check for the cancer prediction.
Also, details about breast cancer, information about project and models evaluation and metrics are also included.
